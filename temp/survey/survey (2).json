Also, I've heard there's real environmental concerns about AI usage, but I know that's not really something you can control."

However, I'm still just not really comfortable with having AI be used from an ethical stand point. The prices and designs for your stuff are amazing, and from what I've seen I'd love to get decals from you guys more often, I just wish that I didn't have the concerns about moral related issues going into utilizing AI for a lot of said designs. Additionally, I've heard you guys do a lot of wraps and other physical branding-- it would be really cool to see some of that displayed here and have more information about prices/other commercial related things. All of the displayed window graphics are AI generated and not actually printed out on the windows, so it would be really cool to see actual photos of how some of your wraps or displays have turned out for local customers so people will know what they're getting into before they ask for a graphic."
