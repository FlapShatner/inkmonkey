### Technology

This project is written in Typescript and using the Next.js fullstack framework. TailwindCSS is used for styling, Jotai for some state management, Prisma ORM for database interaction, and the shopify headless api for managing products and checkouts. The image generator app uses websockets to connect with Midjourney over discord, store generated images with cloudinary, and display them for purchase as a physical decal or graphic to be printed and delivered to the customer.

### Features

The site is a fully featured ecommerce application with all bespoke product galleries, product pages, shopping cart, product search and filtering.
An AI image generating application is integrated, allowing users to generate an image using Midjourney and then purchase a decal using the design.
